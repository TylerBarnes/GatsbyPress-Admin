☐ Setup template hierarchy routing. Should only be for single posts using "default-${post_type}".
☐ Setup default routing for taxonomy pages. Respect wether they should have an archive or not.
☐ Make sure the attached terms / taxonomies for a post are coming through
☐ Make sure there is atleast one hidden post for each post type
☐ Add previews to the admin page! :)
