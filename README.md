# Wordsby Admin (WIP)

A WordPress theme to make Gatsby development and content creation in WordPress easier.
Features include a template hierarchy, usage of the WP permalink structure in gatsby, instant page previews and much more.
Instead of using `gatsby-source-wordpress`, this theme commits images and data directly to your git repo (Github and Gitlab are supported). This means your 5,000 page site can run on $2 shared hosting and get the performance of a finely tuned VPS.
It also means running  `gatsby develop` on large WP sites doesn't require repeatedly downloading your entire media library.

This theme is intended to be used with Gatsby plugin [Wordsby](https://github.com/TylerBarnes/wordsby).

Check out the [Wordsby readme](https://github.com/TylerBarnes/wordsby) for more info.

## Installation

1. Download this repo as a zip
2. Upload it to your WP install and activate it as a theme
3. [Connect your install to Github or Gitlab](#githubgitlab-connection)
4. [Follow the setup instructions for Wordsby](https://github.com/TylerBarnes/wordsby#set-up)

## Github/Gitlab connection

In `wp-config.php`, add any of the following applicable lines.
```php
// for Gitlab
// https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#doc-nav
define('WORDLIFY_GITLAB_API_TOKEN', 'your-api-token'); 
define('WORDLIFY_GITLAB_PROJECT_ID', 'your-project-id');

// for Github
// https://github.com/settings/tokens
define('WORDLIFY_GITHUB_API_TOKEN', 'your-api-token'); 
define('WORDLIFY_GITHUB_OWNER', 'your-github-username');
define('WORDLIFY_GITHUB_REPO', 'your-repo-name');

// for both
define('WORDLIFY_GIT_HOST', 'github'); // or "gitlab"
define('WORDLIFY_BRANCH', 'master'); // pick the main branch.
```

When you upload media files, they'll be commited to a temporary branch. Once you save a post or page, the branch will be automatically merged into your main branch. This prevents your CI pipeline from building your gatsby site every time you upload a media file.
